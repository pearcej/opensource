<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">A few time-saving shell commands.</span></h4> <div class="para"></div> <div class="para">The <em class="emphasis">up arrow</em> key retrieves the previous shell command. If you press it multiple times, it will take you back through multiple commands in your shell history. This is a useful way to repeat a command. For example, if you had a typo, you can use the up arrow, edit the command, and push enter to fix the command. Analogously, the <em class="emphasis">down arrow</em> will move you in the reverse direction through the shell command history. For more useful shell commands, type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man bash</code> for hints on how to search your shell history, re-execute commands, and much more.</div> <div class="para">This paragraph is intended to alert you to some useful search features. A couple examples of very common search patterns are using wildcards for zero or more characters or for a single character.  The asterisk (*) specifies zero or more characters to match. In bash the question mark (?) is used for matching exactly one single character.</div> <div class="para">For example, if we type the following:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm -i newfile?.txt
</pre>
<div class="para">Then the question mark will match with any single character, and we will see the following prompts:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm: remove regular file 'newfile2.txt'?
rm: remove regular file 'newfile4.txt'?
</pre>
<div class="para">If we instead type:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm -i newfile*.txt
</pre>
<div class="para">Then the asterisk will match with any number of characters (including zero), and we will see the following prompts:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm: remove regular file 'newfile2.txt'?
rm: remove regular file 'newfile4.txt'?
rm: remove regular file 'newfile2_cp.txt'?
</pre>
<div class="para">As you can see, these search patterns give you a lot of power and control.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#paragraphs-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
