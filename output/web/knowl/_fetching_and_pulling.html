<p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git fetch &lt;remote&gt;
</pre>
<p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.</p>
<p>If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git fetch origin</code> fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It’s important to note that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.</p>
<p>If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section on Git Branching for more information), you can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git clone</code> command automatically sets up your local <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch to track the remote <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.</p>
<p>Note: From git version 2.27 onward, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> will give a warning if the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pull.rebase</code> variable is not set. Git will keep warning you until you set the variable.</p>
<p>If you want the default behavior of git (fast-forward if possible, else create a merge commit): <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git config --global pull.rebase "false"</code></p>
<p>If you want to rebase when pulling: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git config --global pull.rebase "true"</code></p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_basics.html#_fetching_and_pulling" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
