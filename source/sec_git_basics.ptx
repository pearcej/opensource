  <title>Git Basics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
    If you can read only one section to get going with Git, this is it. This section covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of this section, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. You will also learn how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

			<title>Getting a Git Repository</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="olist arabic"-->
			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
			<p>
				You can <em>clone</em> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p><!--</div attr= class="olist arabic">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.

				<title>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which system you’re running:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					for Linux:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cd /home/user/my_project</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					for macOS:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cd /Users/user/my_project</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					for Windows:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					and type:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git init</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This creates a new subdirectory named <c>.git</c> that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. 
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few <c>git add</c> commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a <c>git commit</c>:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_git_cloning">
				<title>Cloning an Existing Repository</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you need is <c>git clone</c>. If you’re familiar with other VCSs such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important distinction — instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run <c>git clone</c>. 
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You clone a repository with <c>git clone &lt;url&gt;</c>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called <c>libgit2</c>, you can do so like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					That creates a directory named <c>libgit2</c>, initializes a <c>.git</c> directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new <c>libgit2</c> directory that was just created, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than <c>libgit2</c>, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called <c>mylibgit</c>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the <c>https://</c> protocol, but you may also see <c>git://</c> or <c>user@server:path/to/repo.git</c>, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.

  		<subsection xml:id="_recording_changes_to_the_repository">
			<title>Recording Changes to the Repository</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				At this point, you should have a <em>bona fide</em> Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or <em>working copy</em> of all of its files in front of you. Typically, you’ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: <em>tracked</em> or <em>untracked</em>. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->

			<paragraphs xml:id="_checking_status">
				<title>Checking the Status of Your Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <c>git status</c> command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server. For now, that branch is always <c>master</c>, which is the default; you won’t worry about it here. <!-- TODO --> The next section on Git Branching will go over branches and references in detail.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Let’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple <c>README</c> file. If the file didn’t exist before, and you run <c>git status</c>, you see your untracked file like so:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ echo 'My Project' &gt; README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

    README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can see that your new <c>README</c> file is untracked, because it’s under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn’t yet been staged; Git won’t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you don’t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include. You do want to start including <c>README</c>, so let’s start tracking the file.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_tracking_files">
				<title>Tracking New Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <c>git add</c>. To begin tracking the <c>README</c> file, you can run this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you run your status command again, you can see that your <c>README</c> file is now tracked and staged to be committed:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can tell that it’s staged because it’s under the “Changes to be committed” heading. If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <c>git add</c> is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot. You may recall that when you ran <c>git init</c> earlier, you then ran <c>git add &lt;files&gt;</c> — that was to begin tracking files in your directory. The <c>git add</c> command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it’s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.

			<paragraphs xml:id="_staging_modified_files">
				<title>Staging Modified Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> and then run your <c>git status</c> command again, you get something that looks like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the <c>git add</c> command. <c>git add</c> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”. Let’s run <c>git add</c> now to stage the <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file, and then run <c>git status</c> again:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> before you commit it. You open it again and make that change, and you’re ready to commit. However, let’s run <c>git status</c> one more time:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ vim CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

Changes not staged for commit:

  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					What the heck? Now <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> is listed as both staged <em>and</em> unstaged. How is that possible? It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the <c>git add</c> command. If you commit now, the version of <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> as it was when you last ran the <c>git add</c> command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run <c>git commit</c>. If you modify a file after you run <c>git add</c>, you have to run <c>git add</c> again to stage the latest version of the file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_short_status">
				<title>Short Status</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					While the <c>git status</c> output is pretty comprehensive, it’s also quite wordy. Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run <c>git status -s</c> or <c>git status --short</c> you get a far more simplified output from the command:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status -s
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb
M  lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					New files that aren’t tracked have a <c>??</c> next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an <c>A</c>, modified files have an <c>M</c> and so on. There are two columns to the output — the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree. So for example in that output, the <c>README</c> file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged, while the <c>lib/simplegit.rb</c> file is modified and staged. The <c>Rakefile</c> was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.

			<paragraphs xml:id="_ignoring">
				<title>Ignoring Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Often, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named <c>.gitignore</c>. Here is an example <c>.gitignore</c> file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in “.o” or “.a” — object and archive files that may be the product of building your code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (<c>~</c>), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files. You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting up a <c>.gitignore</c> file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don’t accidentally commit files that you really don’t want in your Git repository.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The rules for the patterns you can put in the <c>.gitignore</c> file are as follows:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="ulist"-->
				<p><ul>
					<li>
									<p>
					Blank lines or lines starting with <c>#</c> are ignored.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					You can start patterns with a forward slash (<c>/</c>) to avoid recursivity.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					You can end patterns with a forward slash (<c>/</c>) to specify a directory.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (<c>!</c>).
				</p>
					</li>

				</ul></p><!--</div attr= class="ulist">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (<c>*</c>) matches zero or more characters; <c>[abc]</c> matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (<c>?</c>) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen (<c>[0-9]</c>) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; <c>a/**/z</c> would match <c>a/z</c>, <c>a/b/z</c>, <c>a/b/c/z</c>, and so on.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Here is another example <c>.gitignore</c> file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre># ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

        
				<hint>
          <p>
            Tip: GitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good <c>.gitignore</c> file examples for dozens of projects and languages at <url href="https://github.com/github/gitignore" visual="github.com/github/gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore</url> if you want a starting point for your project.
          </p>
        </hint>	
				

				<p>
					Note: In the simple case, a repository might have a single <c>.gitignore</c> file in its root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However, it is also possible to have additional <c>.gitignore</c> files in subdirectories. The rules in these nested <c>.gitignore</c> files apply only to the files under the directory where they are located. The Linux kernel source repository has 206 <c>.gitignore</c> files.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

					Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or modified that you haven’t run <c>git add</c> on since you edited them — won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk. In this case, let’s say that the last time you ran <c>git status</c>, you saw that everything was staged, so you’re ready to commit your changes. The simplest way to commit is to type <c>git commit</c>:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can see that the default commit message contains the latest output of the <c>git status</c> command commented out and one empty line on top. You can remove these comments and type your commit message, or you can leave them there to help you remember what you’re committing.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->


				<p>
					Note: For an even more explicit reminder of what you’ve modified, you can pass the <c>-v</c> option to <c>git commit</c>. Doing so also puts the diff of your change in the editor so you can see exactly what changes you’re committing.
				</p>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					When you exit the editor, Git creates your commit with that commit message (with the comments and diff stripped out).
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the <c>commit</c> command by specifying it after a <c>-m</c> flag, like this:

				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					Remember that the commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area. Anything you didn’t stage is still sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history.

				<title>Skipping the Staging Area</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow. If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut. Adding the <c>-a</c> option to the <c>git commit</c> command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the <c>git add</c> part:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

				<p>
					Notice how you don’t have to run <c>git add</c> on the <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file in this case before you commit. That’s because the <c>-a</c> flag includes all changed files. This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.

				<title>Removing Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit. The <c>git rm</c> command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the “Changes not staged for commit” (that is, <em>unstaged</em>) area of your <c>git status</c> output:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Then, if you run <c>git rm</c>, it stages the file’s removal:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm PROJECTS.md
rm 'PROJECTS.md'
$ git status

  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    deleted:    PROJECTS.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked. If you modified the file or had already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the <c>-f</c> option. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn’t yet been recorded in a snapshot and that can’t be recovered from Git.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your <c>.gitignore</c> file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of <c>.a</c> compiled files. To do this, use the <c>--cached</c> option:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm --cached README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the <c>git rm</c> command. That means you can do things such as:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm log/\*.log</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Note the backslash (<c>\</c>) in front of the <c>*</c>. This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell’s filename expansion. This command removes all files that have the <c>.log</c> extension in the <c>log/</c> directory. Or, you can do something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm \*~</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This command removes all files whose names end with a <c>~</c>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_git_mv">
				<title>Moving Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Unlike many other VCSs, Git doesn’t explicitly track file movement. If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file. However, Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact — we’ll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Thus it’s a bit confusing that Git has a <c>mv</c> command. If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git mv file_from file_to</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					and it works fine. In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you’ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					However, this is equivalent to running something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Git figures out that it’s a rename implicitly, so it doesn’t matter if you rename a file that way or with the <c>mv</c> command. The only real difference is that <c>git mv</c> is one command instead of three — it’s a convenience function. More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the <c>add</c>/<c>rm</c> later, before you commit.

				You may be wondering what the difference is between <em>author</em> and <em>committer</em>. The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work. So, if you send in a patch to a project and one of the core members applies the patch, both of you get credit — you as the author, and the core member as the committer.

				The <c>oneline</c> and <c>format</c> option values are particularly useful with another <c>log</c> option called <c>--graph</c>. This option adds a nice little ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history:

				<title>Limiting Log Output</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					In addition to output-formatting options, <c>git log</c> takes a number of useful limiting options; that is, options that let you show only a subset of commits. You’ve seen one such option already — the <c>-2</c> option, which displays only the last two commits. In fact, you can do <c>-&lt;n&gt;</c>, where <c>n</c> is any integer to show the last <c>n</c> commits. In reality, you’re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					However, the time-limiting options such as <c>--since</c> and <c>--until</c> are very useful. For example, this command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git log --since=2.weeks</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This command works with lots of formats — you can specify a specific date like <c>"2008-01-15"</c>, or a relative date such as <c>"2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago"</c>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria. The <c>--author</c> option allows you to filter on a specific author, and the <c>--grep</c> option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->
				<p>
					Note: You can specify more than one instance of both the <c>--author</c> and <c>--grep</c> search criteria, which will limit the commit output to commits that match <em>any</em> of the <c>--author</c> patterns and <em>any</em> of the <c>--grep</c> patterns; however, adding the <c>--all-match</c> option further limits the output to just those commits that match <em>all</em> <c>--grep</c> patterns.
				</p>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Another really helpful filter is the <c>-S</c> option (colloquially referred to as Git’s “pickaxe” option), which takes a string and shows only those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that string. For instance, if you wanted to find the last commit that added or removed a reference to a specific function, you could call:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git log -S function_name</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The last really useful option to pass to <c>git log</c> as a filter is a path. If you specify a directory or file name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files. This is always the last option and is generally preceded by double dashes (<c>--</c>) to separate the paths from the options:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git log -- path/to/file</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					Tip: Depending on the workflow used in your repository, it’s possible that a sizable percentage of the commits in your log history are just merge commits, which typically aren’t very informative. To prevent the display of merge commits cluttering up your log history, simply add the log option <c>--no-merges</c>.

		<subsection xml:id="_undoing">
			<title>Undoing Changes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				At any stage, you may want to undo something. Here, we’ll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you’ve made. Be careful, because you can’t always undo some of these undos. This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the <c>--amend</c> option:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git commit --amend
      </pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit. You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git add forgotten_file
$ git commit --amend
      </pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				You end up with a single commit — the second commit replaces the results of the first.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

			<p>
				Note: It’s important to understand that when you’re amending your last commit, you’re not so much fixing it as <em>replacing</em> it entirely with a new, improved commit that pushes the old commit out of the way and puts the new commit in its place. Effectively, it’s as if the previous commit never happened, and it won’t show up in your repository history.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

			<p>
				The obvious value to amending commits is to make minor improvements to your last commit, without cluttering your repository history with commit messages of the form, “Oops, forgot to add a file” or “Darn, fixing a typo in last commit”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note: Only amend commits that are still local and have not been pushed somewhere. Amending previously pushed commits and force pushing the branch will cause problems for your collaborators.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The next two sections demonstrate how to work with your staging area and working directory changes. The nice part is that the command you use to determine the state of those two areas also reminds you how to undo changes to them. For example, let’s say you’ve changed two files and want to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type <c>git add *</c> and stage them both. How can you unstage one of the two? The <c>git status</c> command reminds you:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add *

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Right below the “Changes to be committed” text, it says use <c>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;…​</c> to unstage. So, let’s use that advice to unstage the <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

Changes not staged for commit:

  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The command is a bit strange, but it works. The <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file is modified but once again unstaged.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

				<p>
					Note: It’s true that <c>git reset</c> can be a dangerous command, especially if you provide the <c>--hard</c> flag. However, in the scenario described above, the file in your working directory is not touched, so it’s relatively safe.
				</p>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

How can you easily unmodify it — revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed (or initially cloned, or however you got it into your working directory)? Luckily, <c>git status</c> tells you how to do that, too. In the last example output, the unstaged area looks like this:

				<p>
					Important: It’s important to understand that <c>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;</c> is a dangerous command.

Don’t ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don’t want those unsaved local changes.

						What if you realize that you don’t want to keep your changes to the <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file? How can you easily unmodify it — revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed (or initially cloned, or however you got it into your working directory)? Luckily, <c>git status</c> tells you how to do that, too. In the last example output, the unstaged area looks like this:

			<title>Working with Remotes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more. In this section, we’ll cover some of these remote-management skills.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->

			<p>
				<em>Remote repositories can be on your local machine.</em> It is entirely possible that you can be working with a “remote” repository that is, in fact, on the same host you are. The word “remote” does not necessarily imply that the repository is somewhere else on the network or Internet, only that it is elsewhere. Working with such a remote repository would still involve all the standard pushing, pulling and fetching operations as with any other remote.

					To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the <c>git remote</c> command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see <c>origin</c> — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:

					We’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the <c>git clone</c> command implicitly adds the <c>origin</c> remote for you. Here’s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run <c>git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;</c>:

We’ll go over what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in the next subsection on Git Branching.

			<paragraphs xml:id="_fetching_and_pulling">
				<title>Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, <c>git fetch origin</c> fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It’s important to note that the <c>git fetch</c> command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section on Git Branching for more information), you can use the <c>git pull</c> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <c>git clone</c> command automatically sets up your local <c>master</c> branch to track the remote <c>master</c> branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running <c>git pull</c> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->


				<p>
					Note: From git version 2.27 onward, <c>git pull</c> will give a warning if the <c>pull.rebase</c> variable is not set. Git will keep warning you until you set the variable.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want the default behavior of git (fast-forward if possible, else create a merge commit): <c>git config --global pull.rebase "false"</c>
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to rebase when pulling: <c>git config --global pull.rebase "true"</c>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_pushing_remotes">
				<title>Pushing to Your Remotes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: <c>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</c>. If you want to push your <c>master</c> branch to your <c>origin</c> server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git push origin master</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. See the next section on Git Branching for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.

				<title>Inspecting a Remote</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the <c>git remote show &lt;remote&gt;</c> command. If you run this command with a particular shortname, such as <c>origin</c>, you get something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->

					It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information.

It also lists all the remote references it has pulled down.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change — it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					By default, the <c>git push</c> command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches — you can run <c>git push origin &lt;tagname&gt;</c>.

				<title>Deleting Tags</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use <c>git tag -d &lt;tagname&gt;</c>. For example, we could remove our lightweight tag above as follows:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git tag -d v1.4-lw
Deleted tag 'v1.4-lw' (was e7d5add)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Note that this does not remove the tag from any remote servers. There are two common variations for deleting a tag from a remote server.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The first variation is <c>git push &lt;remote&gt; :refs/tags/&lt;tagname&gt;</c>:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git push origin :refs/tags/v1.4-lw
To /git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         v1.4-lw</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The way to interpret the above is to read it as the null value before the colon is being pushed to the remote tag name, effectively deleting it.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The second (and more intuitive) way to delete a remote tag is with:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git push origin --delete &lt;tagname&gt;</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

				<title>Checking out Tags</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a <c>git checkout</c> of that tag, although this puts your repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git checkout v2.0.0
Note: switching to 'v2.0.0'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final

$ git checkout v2.0-beta-0.1

HEAD is now at df3f601... Add atlas.json and cover image</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					In “detached HEAD” state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag will stay the same, but your new commit won’t belong to any branch and will be unreachable, except by the exact commit hash. Thus, if you need to make changes — say you’re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance — you will generally want to create a branch:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
Switched to a new branch 'version2'</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you do this and make a commit, your <c>version2</c> branch will be slightly different than your <c>v2.0.0</c> tag since it will move forward with your new changes, so do be careful.

			<title>Git Aliases</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				Before we move on to the next chapter, we want to introduce a feature that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases. For clarity’s sake, we won’t be using them anywhere else in this book, but if you go on to use Git with any regularity, aliases are something you should know about.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				Git doesn’t automatically infer your command if you type it in partially. If you don’t want to type the entire text of each of the Git commands, you can easily set up an alias for each command using <c>git config</c>. Here are a couple of examples you may want to set up:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				This means that, for example, instead of typing <c>git commit</c>, you just need to type <c>git ci</c>. As you go on using Git, you’ll probably use other commands frequently as well; don’t hesitate to create new aliases.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				This technique can also be very useful in creating commands that you think should exist. For example, to correct the usability problem you encountered with unstaging a file, you can add your own unstage alias to Git:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				This makes the following two commands equivalent:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git unstage fileA
$ git reset HEAD -- fileA</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				This seems a bit clearer. It’s also common to add a <c>last</c> command, like this:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				This way, you can see the last commit easily:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git last

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				As you can tell, Git simply replaces the new command with whatever you alias it for. However, maybe you want to run an external command, rather than a Git subcommand. In that case, you start the command with a <c>!</c> character. This is useful if you write your own tools that work with a Git repository. We can demonstrate by aliasing <c>git visual</c> to run <c>gitk</c>:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
			<pre>$ git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

      At this point, you can do all the basic local Git operations — creating or cloning a repository, making changes, staging and committing those changes, and viewing the history of all the changes the repository has been through. Next, we’ll cover Git’s killer feature: its branching model.
