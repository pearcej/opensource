  <title>Git Basics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
    If you could read only one section to get going with Git, this would be the one to read. This section covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of this section, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. You will also learn how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

			<title>Getting a Git Repository</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				You typically obtain an existing Git repository in one of two ways:
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="olist arabic"-->
			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				You can take an existing local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or

				</li>

				<li>
			<p>
				You can <em>clone</em> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p><!--</div attr= class="olist arabic">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.

				<title>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which system you’re running:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					for Linux:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cd /home/user/my_project</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					for macOS:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cd /Users/user/my_project</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					for Windows:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					and type:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git init</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This creates a new subdirectory named <c>.git</c> that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. 
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few <c>git add</c> commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a <c>git commit</c>:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->

			<paragraphs xml:id="_git_cloning">
				<title>Cloning an Existing Repository</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you need is <c>git clone</c>. If you’re familiar with other VCSs such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important distinction — instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run <c>git clone</c>. 
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You clone a repository with <c>git clone &lt;url&gt;</c>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called <c>libgit2</c>, you can do so like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					That creates a directory named <c>libgit2</c>, initializes a <c>.git</c> directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new <c>libgit2</c> directory that was just created, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than <c>libgit2</c>, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called <c>mylibgit</c>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the <c>https://</c> protocol, but you may also see <c>git://</c> or <c>user@server:path/to/repo.git</c>, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.

  		<subsection xml:id="_recording_changes_to_the_repository">
			<title>Recording Changes to the Repository</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				At this point, you should have a <em>bona fide</em> Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or <em>working copy</em> of all of its files in front of you. Typically, you’ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: <em>tracked</em> or <em>untracked</em>. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

			<paragraphs xml:id="_checking_status">
				<title>Checking the Status of Your Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <c>git status</c> command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server. That branch is typically <c>main</c>, which is the current default. It could also be <c>main</c>, which was the default until October 1, 2020. Don't worry about it here. <!-- TODO --> The next section on Git Branching will go over branches and references in detail.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Let’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple <c>README</c> file. If the file didn’t exist before, and you run <c>git status</c>, you see your untracked file like so:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ echo 'My Project' &gt; README
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

    README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can see that your new <c>README</c> file is untracked, because it’s under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn’t yet been staged; Git won’t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you don’t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include. You do want to start including <c>README</c>, so let’s start tracking the file.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_tracking_files">
				<title>Tracking New Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <c>git add</c>. To begin tracking the <c>README</c> file, you can run this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you run your status command again, you can see that your <c>README</c> file is now tracked and staged to be committed:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can tell that it’s staged because it’s under the “Changes to be committed” heading. If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <c>git add</c> is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot. You may recall that when you ran <c>git init</c> earlier, you then ran <c>git add &lt;files&gt;</c> — that was to begin tracking files in your directory. The <c>git add</c> command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it’s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.

			<paragraphs xml:id="_staging_modified_files">
				<title>Staging Modified Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> and then run your <c>git status</c> command again, you get something that looks like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the <c>git add</c> command. <c>git add</c> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”. Let’s run <c>git add</c> now to stage the <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file, and then run <c>git status</c> again:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> before you commit it. You open it again and make that change, and you’re ready to commit. However, let’s run <c>git status</c> one more time:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:

  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					What the heck? Now <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> is listed as both staged <em>and</em> unstaged. How is that possible? It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the <c>git add</c> command. If you commit now, the version of <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> as it was when you last ran the <c>git add</c> command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run <c>git commit</c>. If you modify a file after you run <c>git add</c>, you have to run <c>git add</c> again to stage the latest version of the file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_short_status">
				<title>Short Status</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					While the <c>git status</c> output is pretty comprehensive, it’s also quite wordy. Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run <c>git status -s</c> or <c>git status --short</c> you get a far more simplified output from the command:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git status -s
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb

?? LICENSE.txt</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					New files that aren’t tracked have a <c>??</c> next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an <c>A</c>, modified files have an <c>M</c> and so on. There are two columns to the output — the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree. So for example in that output, the <c>README</c> file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged, while the <c>lib/simplegit.rb</c> file is modified and staged. The <c>Rakefile</c> was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.

			<paragraphs xml:id="_ignoring">
				<title>Ignoring Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Often, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named <c>.gitignore</c>. Here is an example <c>.gitignore</c> file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in “.o” or “.a” — object and archive files that may be the product of building your code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (<c>~</c>), which is used by some text editors  to mark temporary files. You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting up a <c>.gitignore</c> file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don’t accidentally commit files that you really don’t want in your Git repository.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The rules for the patterns you can put in the <c>.gitignore</c> file are as follows:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="ulist"-->
				<p><ul>
					<li>
									<p>
					Blank lines or lines starting with <c>#</c> are ignored.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					You can start patterns with a forward slash (<c>/</c>) to avoid recursivity.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					You can end patterns with a forward slash (<c>/</c>) to specify a directory.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (<c>!</c>).
				</p>
					</li>

				</ul></p><!--</div attr= class="ulist">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (<c>*</c>) matches zero or more characters; <c>[abc]</c> matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (<c>?</c>) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen (<c>[0-9]</c>) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; <c>a/**/z</c> would match <c>a/z</c>, <c>a/b/z</c>, <c>a/b/c/z</c>, and so on.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Here is another example <c>.gitignore</c> file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre># ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

        
				<hint>
          <p>
            Tip: GitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good <c>.gitignore</c> file examples for dozens of projects and languages at <url href="https://github.com/github/gitignore" visual="github.com/github/gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore</url> if you want a starting point for your project.
          </p>
        </hint>	
				

				<p>
					Note: In the simple case, a repository might have a single <c>.gitignore</c> file in its root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However, it is also possible to have additional <c>.gitignore</c> files in subdirectories. The rules in these nested <c>.gitignore</c> files apply only to the files under the directory where they are located. The Linux kernel source repository has 206 <c>.gitignore</c> files.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

Remember that anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or modified that you haven’t run <c>git add</c> on since you edited them — won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk. In this case, let’s say that the last time you ran <c>git status</c>, you saw that everything was staged, so you’re ready to commit your changes.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can see that the default commit message contains the latest output of the <c>git status</c> command commented out and one empty line on top. You can remove these comments and type your commit message, or you can leave them there to help you remember what you’re committing.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->


				<p>
					Note: For an even more explicit reminder of what you’ve modified, you can pass the <c>-v</c> option to <c>git commit</c>. Doing so also puts the diff of your change in the editor so you can see exactly what changes you’re committing.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow. If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut. Adding the <c>-a</c> option to the <c>git commit</c> command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the <c>git add</c> part:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

					Notice how you don’t have to run <c>git add</c> on the <c>CONTRIBUTING.md</c> file in this case before you commit. That’s because the <c>-a</c> flag includes all changed files. This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.

				<title>Removing Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit. The <c>git rm</c> command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the “Changes not staged for commit” (that is, <em>unstaged</em>) area of your <c>git status</c> output:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Then, if you run <c>git rm</c>, it stages the file’s removal:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm PROJECTS.md
rm 'PROJECTS.md'
$ git status

    deleted:    PROJECTS.md</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked. If you modified the file or had already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the <c>-f</c> option. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn’t yet been recorded in a snapshot and that can’t be recovered from Git.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your <c>.gitignore</c> file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of <c>.a</c> compiled files. To do this, use the <c>--cached</c> option:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm --cached README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the <c>git rm</c> command. That means you can do things such as:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm log/\*.log</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Note the backslash (<c>\</c>) in front of the <c>*</c>. This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell’s filename expansion. This command removes all files that have the <c>.log</c> extension in the <c>log/</c> directory. Or, you can do something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git rm \*~</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This command removes all files whose names end with a <c>~</c>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_git_mv">
				<title>Moving Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Unlike many other VCSs, Git doesn’t explicitly track file movement. If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file. However, Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact — we’ll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Thus it’s a bit confusing that Git has a <c>mv</c> command. If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git mv file_from file_to</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					and it works fine. In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you’ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					However, this is equivalent to running something like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Git figures out that it’s a rename implicitly, so it doesn’t matter if you rename a file that way or with the <c>mv</c> command. The only real difference is that <c>git mv</c> is one command instead of three — it’s a convenience function. More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the <c>add</c>/<c>rm</c> later, before you commit.

			<title>Working with Remotes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
			<p>
				To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more. In this section, we’ll cover some of these remote-management skills.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->

			<p>
				<em>Remote repositories can be on your local machine.</em> It is entirely possible that you can be working with a “remote” repository that is, in fact, on the same host you are. The word “remote” does not necessarily imply that the repository is somewhere else on the network or Internet, only that it is elsewhere. Working with such a remote repository would still involve all the standard pushing, pulling and fetching operations as with any other remote.

				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git remote
origin
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb  https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb  https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Now you can use the string <c>pb</c> on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run <c>git fetch pb</c>:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git fetch pb
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
 * [new branch]      main     -&gt; pb/main
 * [new branch]      ticgit     -&gt; pb/ticgit</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Paul’s <c>main</c> branch is now accessible locally as <c>pb/main</c> — you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it. We’ll go over what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in the next subsection on Git Branching.

				<title>Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, <c>git fetch origin</c> fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It’s important to note that the <c>git fetch</c> command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section on Git Branching for more information), you can use the <c>git pull</c> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <c>git clone</c> command automatically sets up your local <c>main</c> branch to track the remote <c>main</c> branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running <c>git pull</c> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->


				<p>
					Note: From git version 2.27 onward, <c>git pull</c> will give a warning if the <c>pull.rebase</c> variable is not set. Git will keep warning you until you set the variable.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want the default behavior of git (fast-forward if possible, else create a merge commit): <c>git config --global pull.rebase "false"</c>
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to rebase when pulling: <c>git config --global pull.rebase "true"</c>
				</p>


<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->

			<paragraphs xml:id="_pushing_remotes">
				<title>Pushing to Your Remotes</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: <c>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</c>. If you want to push your <c>main</c> branch to your <c>origin</c> server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git push origin main</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. See the next section on Git Branching for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.

      At this point, you can do all the basic local Git operations — creating or cloning a repository, making changes, staging and committing those changes, and viewing the history of all the changes the repository has been through. Next, we’ll cover Git’s killer feature: its branching model.
