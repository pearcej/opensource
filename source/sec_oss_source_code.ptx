  <title>About Source Code</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
		Let’s start with an explanation of <em>source code</em>. One cannot understand <em>open source</em> without first understanding source.

    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_source_code">
    <title>What is Source Sode</title>
			<p>
				Source code is a set of instructions for computers that is meant to be read and written by humans.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s an example of source code, in the C programming language, for a simple, but complete, program.
			</p>

	<program xml:id="ex_c_prog" interactive="activecode" language="c">
    <input>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main() { 
  for(;;) { 
    printf ("Hello World!\n"); 
  } 
}
    </input>
	</program>

<!-- non-runnable
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main() { 
  for(;;) { 
    printf ("Hello World!\n"); 
  } 
}</pre> -->

		<p>
			In order to run this program, it must be <term>compiled</term> into machine code using a program called a compiler. First, we save the program into a file called hello.c. Then, we compile it:
		</p>

		<pre>gcc -o hello hello.c</pre>

		<p>
			The compilation command is gcc, which stands for “GNU Compiler Collection.” The flag -o sets the name of the program that we are about to generate; here, we’ve decided to call it hello. The last argument is the name of the source file that we want to compile (hello.c). After compiling the program, you should be able to run it. To run the program, type the following at the prompt:
		</p>

		<pre>./hello</pre>

		<p>
			This says “run the program called hello that is in the current directory.” When run, this program will print Hello World! until we kill the program. Hold down the <term>CTRL</term> key and press the <term>C</term> key to kill the program’s execution.
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, you have two files in your directory: hello.c, the source code, and hello, the program binary. That binary is a piece of that machine code. You can open it with a program called hexdump that will let you see the binary in a hexidecimal form. You can do this yourself on the command line:
		</p>

		<pre>hexdump hello</pre>

		<p>
			We’ve reproduced some of what it looks like when hello is viewed in hexdump after hello.c has been compiled by gcc:<!-- linebreak -->

			That’s only a small chunk of the program binary. The full binary is much larger — even though the source code that produces this binary is only two lines long.
		</p>

		<p>
			As you can see, there’s a huge difference between <em>source code</em>, which is intended to be read and written by humans, and <em>binary code</em>, which is intended to be read and written by computer processors.
		</p>

		<p>
			This difference is a crucial one for programmers who need to modify a computer program. Let’s say you wanted to change the program to say “Open source is awesome!!!”. With access to the source code, making this change is trivial, even for a novice programmer. Without access to the source code, making this change would be incredibly difficult. And this for two lines of code.

	<subsection xml:id="subsec_decompilation">
		<title>On Decompilation</title>
		<p>
			Compilation transforms a high-level language into a low-level language like machine code or byte code. Decompilation is the reverse. The process of reverse engineering a program from its binary code to source code is called <term>decompiling</term>, and the level of difficulty of decompiling a program differs rather significantly by the programming language of the source code. C code is notoriously difficult to decompile, while Java is much easier, partly because of far fewer compiler optimizations and partly because the intact metadata including such details as data types and method names. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The challenges of decompilation and the potential security risks inherent in programs that are closed source led the Research Directorate of the US National Security Agency (NSA) to develop a suite of open source reverse engineering and decompilation tools called <url href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" visual="ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</url>. That this work was developed by one of the top cybersecurity agencies in the world and that they released and maintain it as open source software stands as a very strong testimonial to both the potential security concerns inherent in closed source software and to the potential security benefits of open source software.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that copyright law generally provides the copyright holder with a set of exclusive rights. Decompilation is carried out by making copies of the software program, and so to be in compliance with law, one must consider the copyright before undertaking decompilation. Laws in both the United States and Europe do permit decompilation to a limited extent and for limited specific purposes. Laws in other areas of the world will vary, but reverse engineering a program for the purpose of reselling it under a different name and license would likely open you up to legal battles – the authors of this text strongly caution you against such action.

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-change-the-source-code">
		<title><term>Exercise – Change the source code</term></title>

		<p>
			Change the source code to print out “Open source is awesome!!!” instead of “Hello World!”. Spend no more than half an hour on this exercise.
		</p>
  	</exercise>


	<exercise xml:id="optional-exercise-change-the-binary-code">
		<title><term>Optional (Very Difficult) Exercise – Change the binary code</term></title>

		<p>
			Change the binary code to print out “OSS Rocks!” instead of “Hello World!”. Spend no more than half a day on this exercise.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is actually a very tricky exercise, and it could take you a fair bit of time. We included it here because you might be curious and want to go poking around in the binary. Under most flavors of Linux you should be able to find or install a program called hexedit. To get you started, you use <term>TAB</term> to switch from hex to ASCII, / to search, and <term>F2</term> to save your changes. You can read the rest of the documentation for hexedit by reading the manpage, which you can get to by typing man hexedit on the command line, or pressing <term>F1</term> while running hexedit.
