  <title>What is Open Source Software?</title>
      <p>
        This is, first and foremost, a textbook about how people create software collaboratively using a community development model, and about how you can become a member of one of those communities.  When the source code is open to viewing, most people call the result of such work by the name <term>open source software (OSS)</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The following related terms relate to OSS that guarantees additional freedoms:
        <idx>free software</idx>   
        <idx>free and open source software</idx>  
        <idx>FOSS</idx>   
        <idx>FLOSS</idx>  
        <idx>free/libre and open source software</idx>   
       Some people call <term>free software</term> or use both terms: <term>free and open source software (FOSS)</term>. Some people throw in the word libre to clarify the intended meaning of free, and call it <term>free/libre open source software (FLOSS)</term>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        There are valid reasons for the usage of these different terms in different contexts, but for the sake of breadth, we primarily use the terms <term>open source</term> or <term>open source software (OSS)</term> in this book. If you are interested in additional clarification or on the history of these related types of software and the evolution of the terms, see <url href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" visual="www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">What is Free Software</url> by the open source <url href="https://www.gnu.org/" visual="www.gnu.org/">GNU Operating System</url>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The specific definition of the term as we will use it: 

      <definition xml:id="def-open-source">
        <idx>open source</idx>
        <idx>open source software</idx>
        <idx>OSS</idx>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <term>Open source software (OSS)</term> is software that is designed with code that is publicly accessible and openly viewed.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      </p>

      <p>Open source software is typically developed in a collaborative way. It often relies upon peer review and community member contributions, frequently with community members from all over the world. In addition to seeing the code, often anyone can also freely modify and distribute the code as they see fit as long as the open source license is followed. We will explore licensing details in <xref ref="ch_licensing"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Enough of the pep talk. Its time to get started.
